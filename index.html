  <h2><u>Methodology</u></h2>
  
  <p>
    1. <strong>Prototyping and Iterative Development:</strong>
    Begin by developing a basic version of your IoT smart home system using Arduino Nano to control 4 relays, a fingerprint sensor (R307), and a Bluetooth sensor module (RC-05). Prototype the connections and functionalities of each component.
    Iterate on your prototype, progressively adding features like integrating the Arduino Uno mini for servo motor control, creating the Android app with MIT App Inventor, and refining the communication between the app and sensors.
    Use feedback from testing to enhance the system and address any issues.<br><br>

    </div>
    
  </p>
     
2. <strong>Agile Development:</strong>
    BreakING our IoT project into smaller tasks: integrating Arduino Nano with relays, setting up Bluetooth communication with the RC-05 module, connecting the fingerprint sensor, controlling the servo motor with Arduino Uno mini, and building the Android app using MIT App Inventor.
    Work in short iterations or sprints to develop and test each feature, aiming to demonstrate incremental progress.
    Regularly assess and adjust your project plan based on feedback from testing and the evolving requirements of your smart home system.
   <br><br>
3. <strong>Component-Based Development:</strong>
    Divide your IoT smart home project into distinct components: relay control, Bluetooth communication, fingerprint sensor integration, servo motor control, and Android app development.
    Develop and test each component independently, ensuring they function as expected.
    Integrate the components together to create a cohesive and functional smart home system.
   <br><br>
4. <strong>Open Source and Collaborative Development:</strong>
    Leverage the open-source community for Arduino programming, Bluetooth integration, fingerprint sensor libraries, and other relevant components.
    Collaborate with others who have experience in similar projects to seek advice, share ideas, and troubleshoot issues.
    Contribute to open-source repositories by sharing your code and experiences, benefiting others in the community.

   <br>
5. <strong>Test-Driven Development (TDD):</strong>
    Begin by writing tests for each component of your IoT smart home system, specifying expected behaviors and outcomes.
    Develop your Arduino code and Android app incrementally, ensuring they pass the tests you've written.
    Continuously run tests and refine your code to meet the specified requirements while preventing regressions.
